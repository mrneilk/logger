Concept of logging in computer system

Creating a simple application that explain the loggging process in computer systems

Why We Log: The Four Pillars
1. Troubleshooting and Debugging
When a program crashes, it rarely tells the user why in detail. Logs record the exact state of the system leading up to the failure.

Example: If a website goes down, the logs might show a "Database Connection Timeout" at 2:03 AM, pointing the engineer exactly where to look.

2. Security and Auditing
If a system is hacked, logs are the primary tool for digital forensics. They help answer:

Who logged in?

What files did they access?

Where did the request come from (IP address)?

3. Performance Monitoring
Logging isn't just about errors; it’s about health. By logging how long certain tasks take, developers can spot "bottlenecks"—parts of the code that are slowing everything down.

4. Compliance
In many industries (like finance or healthcare), logging is a legal requirement. You must be able to prove who touched sensitive data and when.
